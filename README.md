# Car-plate-recognition

Please read 113db_final report_Haoran Cheng, Guanli Qiao, Jiabao Zhai.pdf

code.txt contains the implementation of the model on the development board

augmentation.ipynb contains the pyhon codes for data augmentation

parameter folder contains all the parameter the model needs 

train_bmp folder contains all the images we feeds to the CNN model

test_bmp folder contains all the images we use to test the accuracy of the model, it is not contained by the train_bmp folder

EE113DB_project.ipynb contains the pyhon codes for the CNN model constructed by Tensorflow library

On usb driver folder has all we need to test if the board can predict a car plate image, this folder must be stored in the usb driver in order to load the data and parameter to the board.
